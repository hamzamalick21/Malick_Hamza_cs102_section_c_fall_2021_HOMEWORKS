# README.md for hw-1 / problem-3

Worked with Nicholas Chin

Actual Code:
#include <stdio.h>
float floatn;
int intn;
char character;
int main()
{
  floatn = 3.1;
  intn = 7;
  character = 'H';
  printf("Result is %f %%d= %d\n", floatn, floatn);
  printf("Result is %d %%f= %f\n", intn, intn);
  printf("Result is %c %%d= %d\n", character, character);
  return 0;
}

Algorithm:
Set variables for float, integer, and character
Set values for those  variables
Try calculating using those variables and values with the wrong %d, %f, or %c

float f
int i
char c
f = 1.1
i = 1
c = A

Try calculating someting using f with %d
Try calculating something using i with %f
Try calculating something using c with %d
